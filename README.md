# 👋 Hi there! I'm Kiarash Sedghi
Welcome to my corner of GitHub! I'm a Ph.D. student in Applied Cryptography at the University of South Florida, where I’m deeply engaged in research that intersects security, privacy, and the cutting edge of cryptographic protocols.

## 👀 A bit about me
- 🔐 I’m passionate about **cryptographic schemes** that safeguard the next generation of networked systems, with a particular focus on post-quantum security and lightweight digital signatures.
- 🤖 I’m also expanding my research into **privacy-enhancing technologies (PETs)** like Multi-party Computation (MPC) and Fully Homomorphic Encryption (FHE).
- 🧠 Always excited by **cryptography, machine learning, and secure system design**!
