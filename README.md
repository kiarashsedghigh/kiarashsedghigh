# 👋 Hi there! I'm Kiarash Sedghi
Welcome to my corner of GitHub! I'm a Ph.D. student in Applied Cryptography at the University of South Florida, where I’m deeply engaged in research that intersects security, privacy, and the cutting edge of cryptographic protocols.

## 👀 A bit about me
- 🔐 I’m passionate about **cryptographic schemes** that safeguard the next generation of networked systems, with a particular focus on post-quantum security and lightweight digital signatures.
- 🤖 I’m also expanding my research into **privacy-enhancing technologies (PETs)** like Multi-party Computation (MPC) and Fully Homomorphic Encryption (FHE).
- 🧠 Always excited by **cryptography, machine learning, and secure system design**!

## 🌱 Currently Learning
I’m constantly evolving my knowledge in **post-quantum cryptography** and **privacy-preserving technologies** to address challenges like privacy, decentralization, and transparency in both distributed authentication systems and privacy-preserving artificial intelligence systems.

## 🤝 Collaboration
I’m looking to collaborate on projects that push the boundaries of **secure authentication mechanisms**, **distributed systems security**, and **cryptographic protocols** for IoT, healthcare, and beyond. If you're working in these areas, let’s connect!
